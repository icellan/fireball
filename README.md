Fireball
========

Fireball - a meteor based CMS for twitter bootstrap sites

Easy maintenance and configuration of your site, for non-technical people (wife proof).

This CMS is based on the various bootstrap templates that can be bought for a relative small amount, from sites like {wrap}bootstrap (https://wrapbootstrap.com/).
The templates need to be split up into their individual components and the components registered in Fireball. The site itself is defined in MongoDB and administered
through a user friendly interface that anyone can use. The goal of this project is to create a completely wife proof CMS system, so you can go work on the more
interesting technical stuff and let the wife manage her own site.

Notes
--------
- The core directory structure and configurations are based on the iron-cli (https://github.com/iron-meteor/iron-cli)
- Uses the following packages:
-- bootstrap3 (https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/)
-- iron-router (https://github.com/iron-meteor/iron-router)
